# PokeClaw E2E QA Checklist

Every build must pass ALL checks before shipping. Run on Pixel 8 Pro (or equivalent).

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Accessibility service enabled
- [ ] Cloud LLM configured (API key set)
- [ ] Local LLM downloaded (Gemma 4)
- [ ] WhatsApp installed with at least 1 contact ("Girlfriend")

---

## A. Cloud LLM — Chat

- [ ] **A1. Pure chat question**: "what is 2+2" → answer in bot bubble, 1 round, no tools, no rocket, no "Starting task...", no "Reading screen..."
- [ ] **A2. Follow-up chat**: after A1, ask "what about 3+3" → answer in bot bubble, context preserved
- [ ] **A3. Chat then task**: chat "hello" → get reply → then "send hi to Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → task executes correctly
- [ ] **A4. Task then chat**: "send hi to Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → completes → then "how are you" → chat reply (not task)
- [ ] **A5. Multiple chat messages**: send 3 chat messages in a row → all get bot bubble replies

## B. Cloud LLM — Tasks

- [ ] **B1. Send message**: "send hi to Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → send_message tool called → message sent → answer in bot bubble
- [ ] **B2. Complex task**: "open YouTube and search for funny cat videos" → opens YouTube → searches → multiple steps shown
- [ ] **B3. Task with context**: "I'm arguing with my girlfriend" → then "send sorry to Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → message content should reflect context
- [ ] **B4. Failed contact**: "send hi to Dad on WhatsApp" → Dad not in contacts → LLM reports failure in bot bubble (not stuck, not "Task completed")
- [ ] **B5. Failed app**: "send hi to Girlfriend on Signal" → Signal not installed → LLM reports can't open app

## C. Cloud LLM — Monitor Workflow

- [ ] **C1. Start monitor**: "monitor Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → top bar shows "Monitoring: Girlfriend" → presses Home
- [ ] **C2. Auto-reply triggers**: Girlfriend sends message → notification caught → WhatsApp opens → reads context → Cloud LLM generates reply → reply sent
- [ ] **C3. Stop monitor**: tap top bar → expand → Stop → monitoring stops

## D. Local LLM — Chat

- [ ] **D1. Pure chat**: switch to Local LLM → "hello" → on-device reply in bot bubble
- [ ] **D2. Chat tab has no task ability**: type "open YouTube" in Chat tab → LLM responds conversationally (doesn't try to control phone)

## E. Local LLM — Task Tab

- [ ] **E1. No input bar**: Task tab has workflow cards only, no text input
- [ ] **E2. Monitor workflow**: tap Monitor card → dialog → enter "Girlfriend" → Start → monitoring activates
- [ ] **E3. Send message card**: tap Send Message card → dialog → fills contact/message → sends

## F. Task Lifecycle UI

- [ ] **F1. Top bar during task**: while task runs → orange "Task running..." + red "Stop" button visible
- [ ] **F2. Send button becomes stop**: while task runs → send button turns red X → tapping it cancels task
- [ ] **F3. Floating button during task**: while task runs in another app → floating circle shows pill with step/tokens + "Tap to stop"
- [ ] **F4. Floating button stop**: tap floating button during task → task cancels
- [ ] **F5. Second task works**: complete task 1 → start task 2 → floating button, top bar, stop button all work
- [ ] **F6. No stuck typing indicator**: after task completes → "..." is replaced by answer or removed

## G. Welcome Screen

- [ ] **G1. Cloud welcome**: new chat → "Cloud LLM enabled" + task examples + subtitle about instructions
- [ ] **G2. Local welcome**: switch to Local → new chat → "Local LLM enabled" + chat examples + subtitle about Task tab
- [ ] **G3. Cloud prompt tap**: tap suggested prompt → stays in Chat tab (not jump to Task)

## H. General UI

- [ ] **H1. Floating button size**: small circle on home screen (not giant)
- [ ] **H2. Keyboard in LLM Config**: Settings → LLM Config → tap API key → keyboard doesn't block field
- [ ] **H3. Layout sizes**: all text/buttons normal size (dp not pt)
- [ ] **H4. Model switcher**: tap model bar → dropdown → switch model → status updates
- [ ] **H5. New chat**: tap pencil icon → clears messages → shows welcome screen
- [ ] **H6. Rename chat**: long-press session in sidebar → rename option → type new name → name updates in sidebar + persists after app restart
- [ ] **H7. Delete chat**: long-press session in sidebar → delete → session removed from sidebar + file deleted
- [ ] **H8. Rename preserves messages**: rename session → open it → all messages still there
- [ ] **H9. Delete correct session**: have 3+ sessions → delete middle one → other sessions unaffected

## I. Cross-App Behavior

- [ ] **I1. Floating button visible in other apps**: start task → agent navigates to WhatsApp/YouTube → floating button visible on top
- [ ] **I2. Return to PokeClaw mid-task**: while task runs in WhatsApp → press recents → tap PokeClaw → see task progress + stop button
- [ ] **I3. Notification during task**: incoming notification while task runs → task not disrupted

## M. Cloud LLM — Complex Tasks

- [ ] **M1. Open YouTube + search**: "open YouTube and search for funny cat videos" → opens YouTube → types in search → results shown → auto-return to PokeClaw
- [ ] **M2. Send contextual message**: "send sorry to Mom on WhatsApp" → opens WhatsApp → finds Mom → types "sorry" (or LLM-generated apology) → sends → auto-return
- [ ] **M3. Screen reading**: "check what's on my screen" → reads current screen elements → describes what's visible in chat reply
- [ ] **M4. System settings**: "open Settings and turn on dark mode" → opens Settings → navigates to Display → toggles dark mode → auto-return
- [ ] **M5. Multi-step app navigation**: "open WhatsApp and find my last message from Mom" → opens WhatsApp → finds Mom's chat → reads last message → reports back
- [ ] **M6. Install app from Play Store**: "install Telegram from Play Store" → opens Play Store → searches Telegram → taps Install (or reports already installed)
- [ ] **M7. Web search**: "open Chrome and search for weather today" → opens Chrome → types query → reads results
- [ ] **M8. Compose email**: "open Gmail and compose an email to test@example.com saying hello" → opens Gmail → compose → fills To/Subject/Body → (stops before send for safety)
- [ ] **M9. Take a photo**: "open camera and take a photo" → opens camera app → taps shutter
- [ ] **M10. Check notifications**: "read my notifications" → pulls down notification shade → reads notification content → reports back
- [ ] **M11. Task with wrong app name**: "send hi on Watsapp" (typo) → Cloud LLM figures out it means WhatsApp → still works
- [ ] **M12. Ambiguous task**: "play music" → Cloud LLM picks a music app → opens it → tries to play something

## L. Task Auto-Return

- [ ] **L1. Auto-return after send message**: "send hi to Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → agent opens WhatsApp → sends → completes → PokeClaw chatroom comes back to foreground
- [ ] **L2. Auto-return shows answer**: after return, bot bubble shows the task result (not blank)
- [ ] **L3. No auto-return for monitor**: "monitor Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → monitor starts → user stays in PokeClaw (not kicked to home, not auto-returned)
- [ ] **L4. Monitor stays in app**: after monitor starts, user remains in PokeClaw chat → can keep chatting
- [ ] **L5. Monitor receives notification without leaving app**: monitor active + stay in PokeClaw → someone sends WhatsApp message → notification caught → auto-reply triggers
- [ ] **L6. Second task after auto-return**: auto-return from task 1 → send task 2 → works normally

## K. Permissions

- [ ] **K1. Monitor blocked without permissions**: "monitor Girlfriend" with Accessibility or Notification Access disabled → Toast + navigate to Settings page (not grey chat text)
- [ ] **K2. Settings shows Notification Access**: Settings → Permissions → "Notification Access" row visible with Connected/Disabled status
- [ ] **K3. Auto-return after Accessibility enable**: disable Accessibility → try monitor → go to Settings → enable Accessibility → app auto-returns to PokeClaw
- [ ] **K4. Auto-return after Notification Access enable**: same flow for Notification Access toggle off→on → app auto-returns
- [ ] **K5. Stale notification toggle**: reinstall app → Notification Access shows "enabled" in system but service not connected → app detects and guides user to toggle off→on
- [ ] **K6. Settings links correct**: tap each permission row in app Settings → leads to correct system settings page:
  - Accessibility → system Accessibility settings
  - Notification → starts ForegroundService / requests POST_NOTIFICATIONS
  - Notification Access → system Notification Listener settings
  - Overlay → system Overlay permission
  - Battery → system Battery optimization
  - File Access → system Storage settings
- [ ] **K7. Full permission setup flow (E2E)**:
  1. Fresh state: disable Notification Access for PokeClaw
  2. Open PokeClaw → type "monitor Girlfriend on WhatsApp" → send
  3. Verify: Toast shows "Enable Notification Access in Settings first"
  4. Verify: app navigates to PokeClaw Settings page
  5. Tap "Notification Access" row → system Notification Listener settings opens
  6. Toggle PokeClaw ON (or OFF→ON if stale)
  7. Verify: auto-return to PokeClaw Settings page
  8. Verify: "Notification Access" row now shows "Connected"
  9. Press back → return to chat → type "monitor Girlfriend on WhatsApp" again
  10. Verify: monitor starts successfully ("✓ Auto-reply is now active")

---

## J. Stress / Edge Cases

- [ ] **J1. Rapid fire**: send 3 messages quickly → no crash, messages queued or latest wins
- [ ] **J2. Empty input**: tap send with empty field → nothing happens
- [ ] **J3. Very long input**: paste 500+ character task → no crash, task starts normally
- [ ] **J4. Accessibility lost mid-task**: if accessibility revokes during task → graceful error, not stuck
- [ ] **J5. Network lost mid-task**: if WiFi drops during Cloud task → error message, not infinite loop
- [ ] **J6. App killed and reopened**: force stop → reopen → clean state, no ghost tasks
- [ ] **J7. Monitor + task simultaneous**: monitor Girlfriend active → send task "open YouTube" → both work, monitor not disrupted

[2026-04-08] [PASS]    G3    Cloud prompt tap → prefillText only, stays in Chat tab (code verified: isTask && isLocalModel guard)
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    K1    Monitor with notification listener disconnected → Toast + navigate to app Settings page
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    K2    Settings page shows "Notification Access" row with Connected/Disabled status

[2026-04-08] [SKIP]    K5    Stale toggle detection — verified by K1
[2026-04-08] [SKIP]    K6    Settings links — each permission row navigable (needs manual tap-through)
[2026-04-08] [ISSUE]   K3-a  Auto-return fires on EVERY service connect, not just user-initiated enable — should only fire after permission flow
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    L1    Send message task → agent opens WhatsApp → completes → auto-return to PokeClaw chatroom
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    L3    Monitor starts → stays in PokeClaw (no press Home)
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    L4    After monitor starts, user still in PokeClaw chat ("staying in PokeClaw" in logs)
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    L6    Second task after auto-return works normally
[2026-04-08] [SKIP]    L2    Auto-return shows answer — needs UI verification (SINGLE_TOP preserves activity instance)
[2026-04-08] [SKIP]    L5    Monitor receives notification without leaving app — needs 2nd device (same as C2)
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    H6    Long-press session → action menu (Rename/Delete) → Rename → dialog with current name → Save → sidebar updated
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    H7    Long-press session → Delete → confirm dialog → session removed from sidebar + file deleted
[2026-04-08] [PASS]    H9    Delete middle session → other sessions unaffected in sidebar
[2026-04-08] [SKIP]    H8    Rename preserves messages — mechanism is frontmatter-only update, messages untouched by design
```
